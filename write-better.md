## If you want to write, why don't you simply use MS Word like everybody else ? 

Good question. 

Microsoft Word has been a colossus since 1983. That's a long time in our industry. 

- Microsoft Word has so many features that a publisher saw a business opportunity in publishing a [Word 2013 Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Word-2013-Bible-Lisa-Bucki/dp/1118488121/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1376346262&sr=8-3&keywords=microsoft+word+bible) that tries to explain them all - in only 1056 pages and 3.8 pounds (1.7 kilograms)
- Microsoft Word is so dominant that its competitors think they have to clone most of its principles instead of thinking out of the box. Thus, they are barely attempting to improve its UI (Apple Pages), to make more suitable for collaborative work on Internet (Google Docs), or make it available for free, with an open-source license, on a broader range of platforms (LibreOffice/OpenOffice)
- Microsoft Word is so dominant that most people don't realize that humankind managed somehow to write interesting things without it during 6000 years. And will most likely manage to continue to write interesting things without it in the future.


## Here we go. Please explain this shiny new concept.

Thank you. 

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

Le me begin with a disclaimer : I am not the author of this concept. I simply have read with an open mind the article [My Daily Writing Routine & Tools - Leo Balbuta - ZenHabits](http://zenhabits.net/daily-writing-routine/). Leo Balbuta had always impress me by the quality of the essays he regularly commits. So when he humbly confessed that part of his writing skills was due to the discovery of a new kind of tool... Well I thought it was worth to follow him, give it a try and see whether it could help me too. 

And yes, **it did**.

So, I'm just here to spread further the good advice.


### Minimalism

As a foreword, I have to warn you that this shiny new concept doesn't try to compete with Microsoft Word on the number of features it offers. Believe me or not, but there are thousands of very clever computer scientists working at Microsoft. It's hard to compete with them on their own field. 

Instead, the new concept is **minimalist**, in the sense that it is based on the counter-intuitive principle that **Less is More !** 

More on that ? Ok. 

- Look at what humans have used for 6000 years to write interesting things. Sheets of paper. Some kind of pens. Sounds *minimalist*, no ? Yet it worked. Well. %date de l'invention du papier ? 
- Less features is great, because it's simpler for the user to learn. Obviously it would be hard to fill 1056 pages of a book  « Sheet paper and Pen Bible - 2013 edition  ».
- Less features is great, because the programmer can focus on designing and implementing the features that are *essential* really *right*. If you don't trust me on this, [trust what the designer behind Gmail explains](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.fr/2010/02/if-your-product-is-great-it-doesnt-need.html).
- Less features is great because it works everywhere. Think about it, when we write, we are no longer standing in front of our desktop running Windows and Word like in 1995-2003. Now we spend a *lot of time* in our browser (webmails, forums, ...) and on our smartphones (Android, iPhone). Does the Microsoft Word colossus helps you there ? Heck, no !
- Moreover, most features of Microsoft Word are not needed anymore. Microsoft Word was designed at a time where we mostly worked on a single computer and printed out our documents. Are we still working this way ? Heck no. 

If you are not convinced, read [Why Write for Paper? Or  How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love HTML](http://www.tedcurran.net/2012/10/why-write-for-paper-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-html/)


### Distraction-free

Now, let's discuss the **distraction-free** aspect 

Less distractions is great, because, when you are typing words, you must **focus** on, well, typing words. Not on trying to understand why Microsoft Word is attempting to force you to arrange the formatting in whichever way Word assumes to be proper.

- So that's why you should go full-screen most of the time.
- So that's why it's actually a good things to remove all these buttons that don't help you to type, but, on the contrary, distract you.
- A radical way to remove all buttons is to let the [WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) simply **die**... and instead you may want to use the markdown syntax.


### I think I got it. But what is that markdown thing ? It is weird !

Don't worry, you are not alone !

It *does* seems strange when your brain has been trained since 1995 to learn that the WYSIWIG concept was the only right concept to do things on a computer. You may know that computers specialists use things like HTML but that was, well, restricted to computer specialists.

If you agree with everything above, but don't get the markdown syntax, don't go back to that Microsoft Word monster. Try first [OmmWriter for Mac and Windows](http://www.ommwriter.com/). That's what I did first too !

It's full-screen, it's minimalist, it's distraction-free, it's clever, it's fun, it's useful to actually write... but you don't have to learn about markdown right now.


## OK. I'm ready to hear you about Markdown now. 

Thank you.

### The need for basic formatting

So, even though OmmWriter is great, you may have noticed that you really need to do some basic formatting while you are writing words. Not advanced stuff like what Word think it is important to do - just basic things : 

- links, because, well, URL are an important concept nowodays
- titles, subtitles, paragraphs, subparagraphs, ...
- lists, numbered or not
- write things in **bold**, *italics*
- not much more

That's where Markdown comes in a handy.

###  So what is Markdown ?

Markdown is not a software - but it can be used in many applications, mobile apps, websties

It's just a **syntax**.

- A bit like HTML if you know what it is... but with far less features (and remember, *less is more !*)
- A bit like Wikipedia's wiki code if you know it... but useful in more places that just Wikipedia
- A bit like BBCode that is used in so many forums... but far less crappy
- A bit like ASCII art... that many people use because they have the intuition that other ways to write have more drawbacks than advantages... and actually that was an essential inspiration for Markdown.

What makes it different from all above is that it's aimed at human beings. 

It was *designed* to be easy to read, easy to write, easy to convert to HTML.

 (*easy* doesn't mean here that you don't have to do *any* effort to learn it - only that the learning curve is steeper)

The easy-export-to-HTML-thing is important because the  « .doc  » proprietary format used to be a big obstacle for competitors that dared to challenge Microsoft Word's de facto monopoly. For example, if were using OpenOffice, you had to make sure that whomever you wanted to share a document with was able to open it.

But HTML is even more ubiquitous than the  « .doc  » (proprietary) format. 
It is *the* standard understood by every web browser around.
So you don't have to worry anymore about Microsoft  « .doc  » being so dominant.

And even in places where HTML is not accepted, Markdown shines too : what is even more ubiquitous that HTML itself ? Plain text. And after all, it's only a well designed kind of ASCII-art (or, I will say, Unicode-art, because ASCII too must die, simply because there a lot of languages around there). 


### How do I learn about it ?

You can read about it on the official webpage : [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

A more gentle way is perhaps to learn it through example. 

This document was itself written with markdown. Because, like Mahatma Gandhi famously put it, we must  « *be the change that we wish to see in the world*  »

So go read the source here and see if you understand : [http://goo.gl/XJDoHk](http://goo.gl/XJDoHk)


## What application should I use ?

Ok, so, because one-size-doesn't-fill-all, we will not replace Microsoft Word with a single application. 

I personally use and like :

- [http://bywordapp.com/](http://bywordapp.com/) for MacOS X
- [http://writeboxapps.com/](http://writeboxapps.com/) , a great extension for Chrome that works offline too
- [Draft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mvilla.draft) on Android
- [https://write-box.appspot.com/](https://write-box.appspot.com/) a simpler online app for other browsers
- [http://markdown-here.com/](http://markdown-here.com/) , a clever extension that allows you to use markdown in Thunderbird, Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo, and more places that have no connection with markdown yet.
- on some great, useful websites like [Trello](https://trello.com/), [http://stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), you don't have to install anything, since they are already aware that Markdown is great to allow their users to format nicely their contributions, while keeping the interface clean and simple for the beginners. My educated guess is that there will be more of them in the future :-)

I didn't test these apps personally but they seem great too :

- [http://markdownpad.com/](http://markdownpad.com/) for Windows
- [http://www.iawriter.com/](http://www.iawriter.com/) for Mac and iPad
- [http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/) for Ubuntu. Not yet for other great linux distributions. But as a free-as-in-freedom software, it is only for people willing to package it on their favorite distro.
- [http://writeboxapps.com/](http://writeboxapps.com/) for iphone/ipad


## The future of markdown

If I wrote this article, it's because I think that the concept of a minimalist markdown editor is really a _great_ idea that could become the paper&pen of the 21st century, a lingua franca that will relegate Microsoft Word as a parenthesis of the history of writing.


### The risk of competitive syntaxes

The biggest concern, in my opinion, would be the persistence of too many *naive* attempts to  « improve  » Markdown in order to boost its success. 

There are already a lot of competitive syntaxes that are either similar in spirit with markdown or simply markdown+my_own_set_of_features. 

Those people think that, maybe it could be useful to add for example a table of contents feature in markdown. The thing is that **internet users just doesn't want to learn 10 flavors of markdown**, and they are right. Remember : simplicity is core feature of a minimalist markdown editor. Killing a core feature of markdown by improving some secondary aspects is really a bad idea. So I hope that the original Markdown syntax will kill all those competitive syntax (I don't want name, let alone link to these competitive syntax, but you can find them easily). 

I will be really sad that Markdown become unsignificant because of that. I will use myself only use plain Markdown 1.0 official features. Because it's good enough. And I will switch only when an Official Markdown 2.0 Open Format comes out. 

[And Jefff Atwood took an interesting initiative in this direction](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html)


### Simple ways to contribute if you are interested

That being said, there are actually useful ways to help markdown to slowly come under the spotlights: 

- first things : just try out yourself one minimalists markdown editor and see if it helps you like it helped Leo Balbuta and myself.
- then you could spread the good advice, like I attempt to do in this article. Translations of this article are more than welcome for example. Wikipedia is important for people curious about a subject they don't yet master. The [current markdown entry - 2 august 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) badly needs some rewriting, that would be another option.
- if you own a website where your users discuss between themselves, you could follow the good example of Trello, Stackoverflow, Github. There are plenty of developer tools that will help you to do this
- there are a lot of forums on the web where people who are passionate about a topic  produce great content... but for example in that crappy, obsolete BBCode thing. The thing is that people are used to it, so that the forum owner just can't move right away from bbcode to markdown. If you are a developper, a tool that would convert from markdown to bbcode would be really useful to ease the migration.
