# If you want to write, why not simply using Word like everybody ?

Fair question. 

Microsoft Word is a colossus since 1983. That’s a long time in our industry. 

- Microsoft Word has so many features that a publisher saw a business opportunity in publishing a [Word 2013 Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Word-2013-Bible-Lisa-Bucki/dp/1118488121/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1376346262&sr=8-3&keywords=microsoft+word+bible) that tries to explain them all - in only 1056 pages and 3.8 pounds (1.7 kilograms)
- Microsoft Word is so dominant that its competitors think they have to clone most of its principles. Only making it marginally better. Wether it is by improving its UI (Apple Pages), by making it more practical for people collaborating on the web (Google Docs), or available for free, with an open-source license, on platforms where Word is not present (LibreOffice/OpenOffice)
- Microsoft Word is so dominant that most people don’t realize that the Humanity managed somehow to write interesting things without it during 6000 years. And will most likely manage to continue to write interesting things without it in the future.


# Here we go. Explain to me your shiny new concept.

Thank you. 

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Le me begin with a disclaimer : I didn’t invent the concept. I simply have read with an open mind the article [My Daily Writing Routine & Tools - Leo Balbuta - ZenHabits](http://zenhabits.net/daily-writing-routine/). Leo Balbuta had always impress me with how much great content he was regulary able to write. So when he honestly said that part of his talent was due to the discovery of a new kind of tool... Well I thought it was worth to trust him, test out the new tool, find out if it will help me too. 

And yes, **it did**.

So, I’m just here to spread further the good advice.


## Minimalism

Then, I have to warn you that this shiny new concept doesn’t try to compete with Microsoft Word on features. Believe me or not, but there are thousands of very clever computer engineers working at Microsoft. It’s hard to beat them on their own field. 

Instead, the new concept is **minimalist**, in the sense that it is based on the counter-intuitive principle that **Less is More !** 

More on that ? Ok. 

- Look at what the Humanity used during 6000 years to write interesting things. Sheets of paper. Some kind of pens. Sounds *minimalist*, no ? Yet it worked. Well.
- Less features is great, because it’s simpler for the user to learn. Obviously it would be hard to write « Sheet paper and Pen Bible - 2013 edition » in 1056 pages.
- Less features is great, because the programmer can focus to design and implement the features that are *essential* really *right*. If you don’t trust me on this, [trust what the designer behing Gmail explains](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.fr/2010/02/if-your-product-is-great-it-doesnt-need.html).
- Less features is great because it works everywhere. Think about it, when we write, we are not always nor most of the time on Windows and Word like in 1995-2003. Now we spend a *lot of time* in our browser (webmails, forums, ...) and on our smartphones (Android, iPhone). Does the Microsoft Word colossus helps you there ? Heck, no !
- Most features of Microsoft Word are not needed anymore anyway. The design of Microsoft Word was made at a time where we mostly worked on a single computer and printed our document on actual sheets of paper. Does that is still the case ? Heck no. 

If you are not convinced, read [Why Write for Paper? Or ‘How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love HTML](http://www.tedcurran.net/2012/10/why-write-for-paper-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-html/)


## Distraction-free

Now, let’s discuss the **distraction-free** aspect 

Less distractions is great, because, when you write words, you must **focus** on, well, writing words. Not on trying to understand why Microsoft Word wants to force you to get your words displayed on paper in the correct way (or what Word *thinks* is the correct way).

- So that’s why you should go full-screen most of the time.
- So that’s why it’s actually a good things to remove all those buttons that don’t help you to write words, but, on the contrary, distract you.
- A radical way to remove all buttons is to let the [WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) simply **die**... and instead you may want to use the markdown syntax.


## I think I got it. But what is that markdown thing ? It seems very strange !

Don’t worry, you are not alone !

It *does* seems strange when your brain have been trained since 1995 to learn that the WYSIWIG concept was the only right concept to do things on a computer. You may know that computers specialists use things like HTML but that was, well, reserved for computer specialists.

If you agree with everything above, but don’t get the markdown syntax, don’t go back to that Microsoft Word monster. Try first [OmmWriter for Mac and Windows](http://www.ommwriter.com/). That’s what I did first too !

It’s full-screen, it’s minimalist, it’s distraction-free, it’s clever, it’s fun, it’s useful to actually write... but you don’t have to learn about markdown right now.


# OK. I’m ready to hear you about Markdown now. 

Thank you.

## The need for basic formatting

So, while OmmWriter is great, you may have noticed that you really need to do some basic formatting while you are writing words. Not advanced stuff like what Word think it is important to do - just basic things : 

- links, because, well, URL are an important concept nowdays
- title, subtitle, paragraphs, subparagraphs, ...
- lists ordered or unordered
- write things in **bold**, *italics*
- not much more

That’s where Markdown comes in a handy.

##  So what is Markdown ?

Markdown is not a software - but it can be used in many softwares, mobile apps, websties

It’s just a **syntax**.

- A bit like HTML if you know what it is... but with far less features (and remember, *less is more !*)
- A bit like Wikipedia’s wiki code if you know it... but useful in more places that just Wikipedia
- A bit like BBCode that is used in so many forums... but far less crappy
- A bit like ASCII art... that many people use because they have the intuition that other ways to write have more drawbacks than advantages... and actually that was an essential inspiration for Markdown.

What makes it different from all above is that it’s aimed at human beings. 

It was *designed* to be easy to read, easy to write, easy to convert as HTML.

 (*easy* doesn’t mean here that you don’t have to do *any* effort to learn it - only that the learning curve is worth it)

The easy-export-to-HTML-thing is important because the « .doc » proprietary format used to be a big obstacle for competitors that dared to challenge Microsoft Word’s de facto monopol. Say you have an openoffice document that you want to share with someone. Ooops, you had to care that she could open your document.

But HTML is even more ubiquitous than the « .doc » (proprietary) format. 
It is *the* standard understood by every web browser around.
So you don’t have to worry anymore about Microsoft « .doc » being so dominant.

And even in places where HTML is not accepted, Markdown shines too : what is even more ubiquitous that HTML itself ? Plain text. And after all, it’s only a well designed kind of ASCII-art (or, I will say, Unicode-art, because ASCII too must die, simply because there a lot of languages around there). 


## How do I learn it ?

You can read about it on the official homepage : [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

A more gentle way is perhaps to learn it by example. 

This document was itself written in markdown. Because, like Mahatma Gandhi famously put it, we must « *be the change that we wish to see in the world* »

So go read the source here and see if you understand : [http://goo.gl/XJDoHk](http://goo.gl/XJDoHk)


# What application should I use ?

Ok, so, because one-size-doesn’t-fill-all, we will not replace Microsoft Word with only one software. 

I personally use and like :

- [http://bywordapp.com/](http://bywordapp.com/) for MacOS X
- [http://writeboxapps.com/](http://writeboxapps.com/) , a great extension for Chrome that works offline too
- [Draft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mvilla.draft) on Android
- [https://write-box.appspot.com/](https://write-box.appspot.com/) a simpler online app for other browsers
- [http://markdown-here.com/](http://markdown-here.com/) , a clever extension that allow you to use markdown in Thunderbird, Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo, and more places that don’t know anything about markdown yet.
- on some great, useful websites like [Trello](https://trello.com/), [http://stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), you don’t have to install anything, since they are already aware that Markdown is great to allow their users to format nicely their contributions, while keeping the interface clean and simple for the beginners. My educated guess is that there will be more of them in the future :-)

I didn’t tested those apps personnaly but they seem great too :

- [http://markdownpad.com/](http://markdownpad.com/) for Windows
- [http://www.iawriter.com/](http://www.iawriter.com/) for mac and iPad
- [http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/) for Ubuntu. Not yet for other great linux distributions. But as a free-as-in-freedom software, it is only for people willing to package it on their favorite distro.
- [http://writeboxapps.com/](http://writeboxapps.com/) for iphone/ipad


# The future of markdown

If I wrote this article, it’s because I think that the concept of a minimalist markdown editor is really a _great_ idea that could become the paper&pen of the 21th century, making of the Microsoft Word area a parenthesis in the history of mankind.


## The danger of competitive syntaxes

The biggest concern, in my opinion, would be the persistence of too many *naive* attempt to « improve » Markdown in order to make it successfull faster. 

There are already a lot of competitive syntax that are either similar in spirit with markdown or simply markdown+my_own_set_of_features. 

Those people think that, maybe it could be useful to add for example a table of contents feature in markdown. Then this or that feature. The thing is that **normal people just don’t want to learn 10 flavors of markdown**. Remember : simplicity is core feature of a minimalist markdown editor. Killing a core feature of markdown by improving some secondary aspects is really a bad idea. So I hope that the original Markdown syntax will kill all those competitive syntax (I don’t want to give names, let alone links to those competitive syntax, but you can find them easily). 

I know I may have sound harsh here. But if you know that things named « planned language » exist, you could be interested by this long article from Zamenhof, NOTE: ADD A LINK AND AN EXPLANATOIN

So I will be really sad that the same story happens again and hurts Markdown. I will use myself only use plain Markdown 1.0 official features. At least until Markdown 2.0 comes out. [And Jefff Atwood took an interesting initiative in this direction](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html)


## Simple ways to contribute if you are interested

That being said, they are actually useful ways to help markdown to slowly come to the spotlights: 

- first things first : just try out yourself one or more minimalists markdown editors and see if it helps you like it helped Leo Balbuta then me
- then you could spread the good advice, like I did in this article. Translations of this article are more than welcome for example. Wikipedia is important for people curious about a subject they don’t yet master. The [current markdown entry - 2 august 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) badly needs some rewriting, that would be another option.
- if you own a website where your users discuss between themselves, you could follow the good example of Trello, Stackoverflow, Github. There are plenty of developer tools that will help you to do this
- there are a lot of forums on the web where people who are passionate about a topic  produce great content... but for example in that crappy, obsolete BBCode thing. The thing is that people are used to it, so that the forum owner just can’t move right away from bbcode to markdown. If you are a developper, a tool that would convert from markdown to bbcode would be really useful to ease the migration.
