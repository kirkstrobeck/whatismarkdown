markdown.mobi
=============

`Markdown` is an open format that you can use everywhere where Plain Text/UTF-8 is allowed ; it is easy to read, easy to write, easy to convert into the most important standards that we currently have, that is HTML and CSS (byword and markdown-here show that it works also well RTF). 

In a nutshell, it is what you need if you want to write for screens, not for a printer (use `latex`or `Word` in those cases)

I think that `Markdown` is better explained in action, so here is a screenshot of how the `ByWord` text editor looks like when I edit my `write-better.md` article 

![Markdown in action](https://raw.github.com/internaciulo/markdown.mobi/master/media/write-better.png)

`Markdown` was invented by John Gruber on http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ but, apart from the fact that nobody can remember this URL, the pedagogy of `Markdown` is yet to be done.

Hence this project.


## This project is a fork from whatismarkdown

Technically, this repository is a fork of the website http://whatismarkdown.com/

The original article has been renamed as what-is-markdown.md

Thanks to  kirk strobeck for having understood like me and before me that this `Markdown` thing has a lot of potential...
but need a lot of pedagogy too.


## What I have added 

- a better DNS : I wanted something easy to remember and to type, no matter what your mother tongue is
- an article of mine that tries to explain [why Writers would benefit from markdown | write-better.md](https://github.com/internaciulo/markdown.mobi/blob/master/write-better.md)

## TODO (a lot)
   *Wisdom is to have dreams that are big enough not to lose sight when we pursue them!* -- Oscar Wilde

I'm currently struggling to launch `markdown.mobi`. 

It will be a multilingual wiki (running on `dokuwiki`) so that non-technical users can contribute too. The format used on this wiki will be ``Markdown`` of course.
    
In an ideal world, I would like to add this on `markdown.mobi`

- document best practices from existing markdown editors. Everybody would benefit from that
- In particular, create a markdown.js file which will make it trivial to implement very useful shortcuts like the [shortcuts from ByWord, Word, Google Apps and others](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AokjkJJJ_Ai2dDJqaTQwVGJQWjZHMWwybXlTcXlONXc&usp=sharing)
- In particular, have a collection of ready-to-use CSS themes. For example  [ByWord.css (if they realease it on a free as in speech licence)](http://bywordapp.com/extras/index.html)
- convince existing text editor to support markdown. For example, I have just opened a feature request for Google Chrome and Google Chrome OS : https://github.com/GoogleChrome/text-app/issues/170
- add more articles explaining what `Markdown` means for different class of users who need markdown but don't know it yer
- I will probably write in french first since thinking in my mother tongue is much easier
- then of course have someone help me to translate them into english
- but also on each other language, provided that there is a volunteer for that


## An official Markdown 2.0 open format is needed

I would like that a an agile standard comitee, something like the [What Working Group](http://www.whatwg.org/) that would look at all those XXX-flavored markdown and alternative-to-markdown-syntaxes things 
and put together ONE coherent markdown 2.0 open format, that would not forget that the Markdown 1.0 essential feature is simplicity.


## Every kind of contribution is welcome

What you can do :

- proof-read my crappy english
- help me to write the markdown.js file that will make it easy to implement standard markdown shortcuts
- help me to document (in english) the best practices of existing editors
- write more articles on markdown
- translate existing articles
- tell me where I can find CSS stylesheets for markdown, available under a free-as-in-speech license
- tell me what you don't like about markdown
- a little "thank you" is welcomed too :-)


If you know how to use github, you can do this by forking the repository, making your own changes, sending pull requests, opening issues ....

Or you can just send me an email at jmfayard+markdown@gmail.com
