=============


## This project is a fork from whatismarkdown

Technically, this repository is a fork of the website http://whatismarkdown.com/

The original article has been renamed as what-is-markdown.md

Thanks to  kirk strobeck.com for having understood like me and before me that there was a big need of pedagogy around that little markdown thing



## What I have added 

- a better DNS : I wanted something easier to understand in every language of the world
- an article of mine that tries to explain why Writers need markdown [write-better.md]
- I think that markdown is better explained in action, so I added a screenshot of Kirk Strobeck's original article as it is displayed in Byword
   [media/markdown_in_action.png]


## What I plan to add

   Wisdom is to have dreams that are big enough not to lose sight when we pursue them!

Technical stuff I want to add

- document best practices from existing markdown editors. Everybody would benefit from that
- In particular, create a markdown.js file which will make it trivial to implement very useful shortcuts like the [shortcuts from ByWord](http://bywordapp.com/extras/index.html)
- In particular, have a collection of ready-to-use CSS themes. For example  [ByWord.css (if they realease it on a free as in speech licence)](http://bywordapp.com/extras/index.html)


Non-technical stuff I want to add

- add more articles explaining what markdown means for different class of users who need markdown but don't know it yer
- first they will be in french since thinking in my mother tongue is much easier for me
- then of course have them translated in english
- but also on each language on the earth. Everyone wanting to volunteer will be more than welcome

(dreaming big) 
- I would like that a an agile standard comitee, something like the [What Working Group](http://www.whatwg.org/) that would look at all those XXX-flavored markdown and alternative-to-markdown-syntaxes things 
and put together ONE coherent markdown 2.0 open format, that would not forget that the Markdown 1.0 essential feature is simplicity.
