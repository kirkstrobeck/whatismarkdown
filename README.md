markdown.mobi
=============


## This project is a fork from whatismarkdown

Technically, this repository is a fork of the website http://whatismarkdown.com/

The original article has been renamed as what-is-markdown.md

Thanks to  kirk strobeck for having understood like me and before me that this markdown thing has a lot of potential...
but need a lot of pedagogy too.


## What I have added 

- a better DNS : I wanted something easier to understand in every language of the world
- an article of mine that tries to explain why Writers need markdown [write-better.md]
- I think that markdown is better explained in action, so I added a screenshot of Kirk Strobeck's original article as it is displayed in Byword
   [media/markdown_in_action.png]


## What I dream to see on markdown.mobi

   Wisdom is to have dreams that are big enough not to lose sight when we pursue them!

Technical stuff I want to add

- document best practices from existing markdown editors. Everybody would benefit from that
- In particular, create a markdown.js file which will make it trivial to implement very useful shortcuts like the [shortcuts from ByWord](http://bywordapp.com/extras/index.html)
- In particular, have a collection of ready-to-use CSS themes. For example  [ByWord.css (if they realease it on a free as in speech licence)](http://bywordapp.com/extras/index.html)


Non-technical stuff I want to add

- add more articles explaining what markdown means for different class of users who need markdown but don't know it yer
- first they will be in french since thinking in my mother tongue is much easier for me
- then of course have them translated in english
- but also on each language on the earth. Everyone wanting to volunteer will be more than welcome


## dreaming big

I would like that a an agile standard comitee, something like the [What Working Group](http://www.whatwg.org/) that would look at all those XXX-flavored markdown and alternative-to-markdown-syntaxes things 
and put together ONE coherent markdown 2.0 open format, that would not forget that the Markdown 1.0 essential feature is simplicity.


## Everykind of contribution is welcome

What you can do :

- proof-read my crappy english
- help me to write the markdown.js file that will make it easy to implement standard markdown shortcuts
- help me to document (in english) the best practices of existing editors
- write more articles on markdown
- translate existing articles
- tell me where I can find CSS stylesheets for markdown, available under a free-as-in-speech license
- tell me what you don't like about markdown
- a little "thank you" is welcomed too :-)


If you know how to use github, you can do this by forking the repository, making your own changes, sending pull requests, opening issues ....

Or you can just send me an email at jmfayard+markdown@gmail.com
